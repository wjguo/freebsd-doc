  <title>Testing the Port</title>

  <sect1 xml:id="make-describe">
    <title>Running <command>make describe</command></title>

    <para>Several of the &os; port maintenance tools, such as
      &man.portupgrade.1;, rely on a database called
      <filename>/usr/ports/INDEX</filename> which keeps track of such
      items as port dependencies.  <filename>INDEX</filename> is
      created by the top-level <filename>ports/Makefile</filename> via
      <command>make index</command>, which descends into each port
      subdirectory and executes <command>make describe</command>
      there.  Thus, if <command>make describe</command> fails in any
      port, no one can generate <filename>INDEX</filename>, and many
      people will quickly become unhappy.</para>

    <note>
      <para>It is important to be able to generate this file no matter
	what options are present in <filename>make.conf</filename>, so
	please avoid doing things such as using
	<literal>.error</literal> statements when (for instance) a
	dependency is not satisfied.  (See
	<xref linkend="dads-dot-error"/>.)</para>
    </note>

    <para>If <command>make describe</command> produces a string rather
      than an error message, you are probably safe.  See
      <filename>bsd.port.mk</filename> for the meaning of the string
      produced.</para>

    <para>Also note that running a recent version of
      <command>portlint</command> (as specified in the next section)
      will cause <command>make describe</command> to be run
      automatically.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="testing-portlint">
    <title>Portlint</title>

    <para>Do check your work with <link
	linkend="porting-portlint"><command>portlint</command></link>
      before you submit or commit it.  <command>portlint</command>
      warns you about many common errors, both functional and
      stylistic.  For a new (or repocopied) port,
      <command>portlint -A</command> is the most thorough; for an
      existing port, <command>portlint -C</command> is
      sufficient.</para>

    <para>Since <command>portlint</command> uses heuristics to try to
      figure out errors, it can produce false positive warnings.  In
      addition, occasionally something that is flagged as a problem
      really cannot be done in any other way due to limitations in the
      ports framework.  When in doubt, the best thing to do is ask on
      &a.ports;.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="testing-porttools">
    <title>Port Tools</title>

    <para>The <package role="port">ports-mgmt/porttools</package>
      program is part of the Ports Collection.</para>

    <para><command>port</command> is the front-end script, which can
      help you simplify the testing job.  Whenever you want to test a
      new port or update an existing one, you can use
      <command>port test</command> to test your port, including the
      <link
	linkend="testing-portlint"><command>portlint</command></link>
      checking.  This command also detects and lists any files that
      are not listed in <filename>pkg-plist</filename>.  See the
      following example:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>port test /usr/ports/net/csup</userinput></screen>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="porting-prefix">
    <title><varname>PREFIX</varname> and
      <varname>DESTDIR</varname></title>

    <para><varname>PREFIX</varname> determines where the port will be
      installed.  It defaults to <filename>/usr/local</filename>, but
      can be set by the user to a custom path like
      <filename>/opt</filename>.  Your port must respect the value of
      this variable.</para>

    <para><varname>DESTDIR</varname>, if set by the user, determines
      the complete alternative environment, usually a jail or an
      installed system mounted somewhere other than
      <filename>/</filename>.  A port will actually install into
      <filename>DESTDIR/PREFIX</filename>, and register with the
      package database in <filename>DESTDIR/var/db/pkg</filename>.  As
      <varname>DESTDIR</varname> is handled automatically by the ports
      infrastructure with &man.chroot.8;, you do not need any
      modifications or any extra care to write
      <varname>DESTDIR</varname>-compliant ports.</para>

    <para>The value of <varname>PREFIX</varname> will be set to
      <varname>LOCALBASE</varname> (defaulting to
      <filename>/usr/local</filename>).  If
      <varname>USE_LINUX_PREFIX</varname> is set,
      <varname>PREFIX</varname> will be <varname>LINUXBASE</varname>
      (defaulting to <filename>/compat/linux</filename>).</para>

    <para>Avoiding hard-coded <filename>/usr/local</filename> paths in
      the source makes the port much more flexible and able to cater
      to the needs of other sites.  Often, this can be accomplished by
      simply replacing occurrences of <filename>/usr/local</filename>
      in the port's various <filename>Makefile</filename>s with
      <literal>&dollar;{PREFIX}</literal>.  This variable is
      automatically passed down to every stage of the build and
      install processes.</para>

    <para>Make sure your application is not installing things in
      <filename>/usr/local</filename> instead of
      <varname>PREFIX</varname>.  A quick test for such hard-coded
      paths is:</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make clean; make package PREFIX=/var/tmp/`make -V PORTNAME`</userinput></screen>

    <para>If anything is installed outside of
      <varname>PREFIX</varname>, the package creation process will
      complain that it cannot find the files.</para>

    <para>In addition, it is worth checking the same with the stage
      directory support (see <xref linkend="staging"/>):</para>

    <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make stage &amp;&amp; make check-orphans &amp;&amp; make package</userinput></screen>

    <para>These tests will not find hard-coded paths inside the port's
      files, nor will it verify that <varname>LOCALBASE</varname> is
      being used to correctly refer to files from other ports.  The
      temporarily-installed port in
      <filename>/var/tmp/`make -V PORTNAME`</filename> should be
      tested for proper operation to make sure there are no problems
      with paths.</para>

    <para><varname>PREFIX</varname> should not be set explicitly in a
      port's <filename>Makefile</filename>.  Users installing the port
      may have set <varname>PREFIX</varname> to a custom location, and
      the port should respect that setting.</para>

    <para>Refer to programs and files from other ports with the
      variables mentioned above, not explicit pathnames.  For
      instance, if your port requires a macro <literal>PAGER</literal>
      to have the full pathname of <command>less</command>, do not use
      a literal path of <filename>/usr/local/bin/less</filename>.
      Instead, use <literal>&dollar;{LOCALBASE}</literal>:</para>

    <programlisting>-DPAGER=\"&dollar;{LOCALBASE}/bin/less\"</programlisting>

    <para>The path with <varname>LOCALBASE</varname> is more likely to
      still work if the system administrator has moved the whole
      <filename>/usr/local</filename> tree somewhere else.</para>
