  <title>A Sample <filename>Makefile</filename></title>

  <para>Here is a sample <filename>Makefile</filename> that you can
    use to create a new port.  Make sure you remove all the extra
    comments (ones between brackets)!</para>

  <para>It is recommended that you follow this format (ordering of
    variables, empty lines between sections, etc.).  This format is
    designed so that the most important information is easy to locate.
    We recommend that you use
    <link linkend="porting-portlint">portlint</link> to check the
    <filename>Makefile</filename>.</para>

  <programlisting>[the header...just to make it easier for us to identify the ports.]
# Created by: Satoshi Asami &lt;asami@FreeBSD.org&gt;
[The optional <emphasis>Created by:</emphasis> line names the person who originally
created the port.  Note that the <quote>:</quote> is followed by a space
and not a tab character.
If this line is present, future maintainers should
not change or remove it except at the original author's request.]

# &dollar;FreeBSD&dollar;
[ ^^^^^^^^^ This will be automatically replaced with RCS ID string by SVN
when it is committed to our repository.  If upgrading a port, do not alter
this line back to "&dollar;FreeBSD&dollar;".  SVN deals with it automatically.]

[section to describe the port itself and the master site - PORTNAME
 and PORTVERSION are always first, followed by CATEGORIES,
 and then MASTER_SITES, which can be followed by MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR.
 PKGNAMEPREFIX and PKGNAMESUFFIX, if needed, will be after that.
 Then comes DISTNAME, EXTRACT_SUFX and/or DISTFILES, and then
 EXTRACT_ONLY, as necessary.]
PORTNAME=	xdvi
PORTVERSION=	18.2
CATEGORIES=	print
[do not forget the trailing slash ("/")!
 if you are not using MASTER_SITE_* macros]
MASTER_SITES=	${MASTER_SITE_XCONTRIB}
MASTER_SITE_SUBDIR=	applications
PKGNAMEPREFIX=	ja-
DISTNAME=	xdvi-pl18
[set this if the source is not in the standard ".tar.gz" form]
EXTRACT_SUFX=	.tar.Z

[section for distributed patches -- can be empty]
PATCH_SITES=	ftp://ftp.sra.co.jp/pub/X11/japanese/
PATCHFILES=	xdvi-18.patch1.gz xdvi-18.patch2.gz

[maintainer; *mandatory*!  This is the person who is volunteering to
 handle port updates, build breakages, and to whom a users can direct
 questions and bug reports.  To keep the quality of the Ports Collection
 as high as possible, we no longer accept new ports that are assigned to
 "ports@FreeBSD.org".]

COMMENT=	DVI Previewer for the X Window System

[dependencies -- can be empty]
RUN_DEPENDS=	gs:${PORTSDIR}/print/ghostscript

[this section is for other standard bsd.port.mk variables that do not
 belong to any of the above]
[If it asks questions during configure, build, install...]
IS_INTERACTIVE=	yes
[If it extracts to a directory other than ${DISTNAME}...]
WRKSRC=		${WRKDIR}/xdvi-new
[If the distributed patches were not made relative to ${WRKSRC}, you
 may need to tweak this]
PATCH_DIST_STRIP=	-p1
[If it requires a "configure" script generated by GNU autoconf to be run]
GNU_CONFIGURE=	yes
[If it requires GNU make, not /usr/bin/make, to build...]
USES= gmake
[If it is an X application and requires "xmkmf -a" to be run...]
USES= imake
[et cetera.]

[non-standard variables to be used in the rules below]
MY_FAVORITE_RESPONSE=	"yeah, right"

[then the special rules, in the order they are called]
pre-fetch:
	i go fetch something, yeah

post-patch:
	i need to do something after patch, great

pre-install:
	and then some more stuff before installing, wow

[and then the epilogue]
