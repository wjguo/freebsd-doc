  <title>Making a New Port</title>

  <para>So, you are interested in making your own port or
    upgrading an existing one?  Great!</para>

  <para>What follows are some guidelines for creating a new port for
    &os;.  If you want to upgrade an existing port, you should read
    this and then read <xref linkend="port-upgrading"/>.</para>

  <para>When this document is not sufficiently detailed, you should
    refer to <filename>/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk</filename>, which all
    port Makefiles include.  Even if you do not hack Makefiles daily,
    it is well commented, and you will still gain much knowledge from
    it.  Additionally, you may send specific questions to the
    &a.ports;.</para>

  <note>
    <para>Only a fraction of the variables
      (<varname><replaceable>VAR</replaceable></varname>) that can be
      overridden are mentioned in this document.  Most (if not all)
      are documented at the start of
      <filename>/usr/ports/Mk/bsd.port.mk</filename>; the others
      probably ought to be.  Note that this file uses a non-standard
      tab setting: <application>Emacs</application> and
      <application>Vim</application> should recognize the setting on
      loading the file.  Both &man.vi.1; and &man.ex.1; can be set to
      use the correct value by typing
      <command>:set tabstop=4</command> once the file has been
      loaded.</para>

    Looking for something easy to start with? Take a look at the
    <link xlink:href="http://wiki.freebsd.org/WantedPorts">list of
      requested ports</link> and see if you can work on one (or
    more).</para>
